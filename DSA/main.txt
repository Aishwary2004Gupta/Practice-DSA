Array : A data structure to store elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory
Binary Search : An efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Bitwise Operators : Operators that work on binary representations of numbers, performing bit-level operations.
Bubble Sorting : A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Conditionals and Loops : Constructs that control the flow of execution based on conditions or repetition of code blocks.
Functions / Methods : Reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task, enhancing modularity.
Linear Search : A simple search algorithm that checks every element in an array sequentially to find a target.
Linked List : A dynamic data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Maze Problems And Backtracking -> Suduko game : Solving pathfinding or arrangement problems using recursion and decision reversal.
OOP (Object Orianted Programming) : A paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world entities and their interactions.
Pattern Questions : Programming exercises to create specific patterns using loops, often for practice with logic and iteration.
