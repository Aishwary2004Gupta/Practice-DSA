Array : A data structure to store elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory
Binary Search : An efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Bitwise Operators : Operators that work on binary representations of numbers, performing bit-level operations.
Bubble Sorting : A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Conditionals and Loops : Constructs that control the flow of execution based on conditions or repetition of code blocks.
Functions / Methods : Reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task, enhancing modularity.
Linear Search : A simple search algorithm that checks every element in an array sequentially to find a target.
